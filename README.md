# Calibration-and-Application-of-Ladybug3-Panoramic-Vision-System

•	Conducted comprehensive research focused on the cutting-edge Ladybug3 panoramic vision system. Investigated various critical aspects, including calibration, image matching, 3D data acquisition, and modeling
•	Utilized C++ for system implementation, highlighting proficiency in software development and experimentation. Developed and fine-tuned methodologies for precise camera distortion parameter calculations to validate the accuracy. Calculated external parameters for the multi-camera system, enabling the transformation between camera image space and world space coordinates. Applied panoramic cameras in photogrammetry and performed extensive experiments with real photographs to confirm the accuracy of the calibration
